Python wrapper for the arXiv API.

arXiv is a project by the Cornell University Library that provides open access to 1,000,000+ articles in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics.

Usage
Installation
$ pip install arxiv 

In your Python script, include the line

import arxiv 

Examples
Fetching results
import arxiv 

# Construct the default API client. 
client = arxiv.Client() 

# Search for the 10 most recent articles matching the keyword "quantum." 
search = arxiv.Search( 
  query = "quantum", 
  max_results = 10, 
  sort_by = arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate 
) 

results = client.results(search) 

# `results` is a generator; you can iterate over its elements one by one... 
for r in client.results(search): 
  print(r.title) 
# ...or exhaust it into a list. Careful: this is slow for large results sets. 
all_results = list(results) 
print([r.title for r in all_results]) 

# For advanced query syntax documentation, see the arXiv API User Manual: 
# https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual#query_details 
search = arxiv.Search(query = "au:del_maestro AND ti:checkerboard") 
first_result = next(client.results(search)) 
print(first_result) 

# Search for the paper with ID "1605.08386v1" 
search_by_id = arxiv.Search(id_list=["1605.08386v1"]) 
# Reuse client to fetch the paper, then print its title. 
first_result = next(client.results(search)) 
print(first_result.title) 

Downloading papers
To download a PDF of the paper with ID "1605.08386v1," run a Search and then use Result.download_pdf():

import arxiv 

paper = next(arxiv.Client().results(arxiv.Search(id_list=["1605.08386v1"]))) 
# Download the PDF to the PWD with a default filename. 
paper.download_pdf() 


======== SEARCH RESULTS ========
# Download the PDF to the PWD with a custom filename. 
paper.download_pdf(filename="downloaded-paper.pdf") 
# Download the PDF to a specified directory with a custom filename. 
paper.download_pdf(dirpath="./mydir", filename="downloaded-paper.pdf") 

The same interface is available for downloading .tar.gz files of the paper source:

import arxiv 

paper = next(arxiv.Client().results(arxiv.Search(id_list=["1605.08386v1"]))) 
# Download the archive to the PWD with a default filename. 
paper.download_source() 
# Download the archive to the PWD with a custom filename. 
paper.download_source(filename="downloaded-paper.tar.gz") 
# Download the archive to a specified directory with a custom filename. 
paper.download_source(dirpath="./mydir", filename="downloaded-paper.tar.gz") 

Fetching results with a custom client
import arxiv 

big_slow_client = arxiv.Client( 
  page_size = 1000, 
  delay_seconds = 10.0, 
  num_retries = 5 
) 

# Prints 1000 titles before needing to make another request. 
for result in big_slow_client.results(arxiv.Search(query="quantum")): 
  print(result.title)

Types
Client
A Client specifies a reusable strategy for fetching results from arXiv's API. For most use cases the default client should suffice.

Clients configurations specify pagination and retry logic. Reusing a client allows successive API calls to use the same connection pool and ensures they abide by the rate limit you set.

Search
A Search specifies a search of arXiv's database. Use Client.results to get a generator yielding Results.

About the arXiv API
The Cornell University e-print arXiv, hosted at arXiv.org, is a document submission and retrieval system that is heavily used by the physics, mathematics and computer science communities. It has become the primary means of communicating cutting-edge manuscripts on current and ongoing research. The open-access arXiv e-print repository is available worldwide, and presents no entry barriers to readers, thus facilitating scholarly communication. Manuscripts are often submitted to the arXiv before they are published by more traditional means. In some cases they may never be submitted or published elsewhere, and in others, arXiv-hosted manuscripts are used as the submission channel to traditional publishers such as the American Physical Society, and newer forms of publication such as the Journal for High Energy Physics and overlay journals.

======== SEARCH RESULTS ======== The primary interface to the arXiv has been human-oriented html web pages. The purpose of the arXiv API is to allow programmatic access to the arXiv's e-print content and metadata. The goal of the interface is to facilitate new and creative use of the the vast body of material on the arXiv by providing a low barrier to entry for application developers.

Quickstart
API calls are made via an HTTP GET or POST requests to an appropriate url. For example, the url

http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron

retrieves results that match the search query all:electron. This url can be accessed from any web-enabled client including your web browser, or via web libraries common to almost all programming languages. There is no arXiv-supplied software that must be downloaded and installed to be able to use the api.

Please see Using the arXiv API, or the User's Manual for more information.

Using the arXiv API
Since the arXiv API is based on the now ubiquitous HTTP, using it should be fairly straight forward from the programming language of your choice. The primary access point for the api is a url that encodes your desired search parameters. For example, the url:

http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=0&max_results=10

indicates that you want to use the api query interface to retrieve the first ten results that match the query all:electron. This url calls the api, which returns the results in the Atom 1.0 format.

Atom 1.0 is an xml-based format that is commonly used in website syndication feeds.

======== SEARCH RESULTS ======== It is better to ask your questions in this forum for all to see. More often than not, someone else has the same question, or can provide an answer. Questions and feedback are the primary information channel that we use to improve this service.

Title: Photometric Redshifts Probability Density Estimation from Recurrent Neural Networks in the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey Data Release 2
Authors: G. Teixeira, C. R. Bom, L. Santana-Silva, B. M. O. Fraga, P. Darc, R. Teixeira, J. F. Wu, P. S. Ferguson, C. E. Martínez-Vázquez, A. H. Riley, A. Drlica-Wagner, Y. Choi, B. Mutlu-Pakdil, A. B. Pace, J. D. Sakowska, G. S. Stringfellow
Published: 2024-08-27 17:59:58+00:00
Summary: Photometric wide-field surveys are imaging the sky in unprecedented detail. These surveys face a significant challenge in efficiently estimating galactic photometric redshifts while accurately quantifying associated uncertainties. In this work, we address this challenge by exploring the estimation of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) for the photometric redshifts of galaxies across a vast area of 17,000 square degrees, encompassing objects with a median 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of $g$ = 24.3, $r$ = 23.9, $i$ = 23.5, and $z$ = 22.8 mag. Our approach uses deep learning, specifically integrating a Recurrent Neural Network architecture with a Mixture Density Network, to leverage magnitudes and colors as input features for constructing photometric redshift PDFs across the whole DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey sky footprint. Subsequently, we rigorously evaluate the reliability and robustness of our estimation methodology, gauging its performance against other well-established machine learning methods to ensure the quality of our redshift estimations. Our best results constrain photometric redshifts with the bias of $-0.0013$, a scatter of $0.0293$, and an outlier fraction of $5.1\%$. These point estimates are accompanied by well-calibrated PDFs evaluated using diagnostic tools such as Probability Integral Transform and Odds distribution. We also address the problem of the accessibility of PDFs in terms of disk space storage and the time demand required to generate their corresponding parameters. We present a novel Autoencoder model that reduces the size of PDF parameter arrays to one-sixth of their original length, significantly decreasing the time required for PDF generation to one-eighth of the time needed when generating PDFs directly from the magnitudes.

Title: Drone-assisted Road Gaussian Splatting with Cross-view Uncertainty
Authors: Saining Zhang, Baijun Ye, Xiaoxue Chen, Yuantao Chen, Zongzheng Zhang, Cheng Peng, Yongliang Shi, Hao Zhao
Published: 2024-08-27 17:59:55+00:00
Summary: Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area. Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering. However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views. In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did. We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process. Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes.

Title: GenRec: Unifying Video Generation and Recognition with Diffusion Models
Authors: Zejia Weng, Xitong Yang, Zhen Xing, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang
Published: 2024-08-27 17:59:41+00:00
Summary: Video diffusion models are able to generate high-quality videos by learning strong spatial-temporal priors on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether such priors derived from a generative process are suitable for video recognition, and eventually joint optimization of generation and recognition tasks. We propose GenRec, a unified framework that leverages diffusion models for both video generation and recognition. Our approach integrates a video diffusion model with a recognition module, enabling the model to learn from both generative and discriminative signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GenRec on several video recognition benchmarks, showing that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high-quality video generation capabilities.
